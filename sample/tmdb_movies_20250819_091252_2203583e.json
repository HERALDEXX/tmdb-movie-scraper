In early November 1918, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann is an unwilling soldier serving on the western front. As the revolutionary movement at home is threatened by the betrayal of the Social Democrats and fissures in the working class, Th\u00e4lmann calls on his fellow soldiers to put down their weapons and unite with the workers in the communist struggle at home. Th\u00e4lmann\u2019s qualms about which side he is fighting on continue, but when the local police attempt to prevent a shipment of provisions and supplies from reaching the people in Petrograd, he intervenes and the ship is unloaded. With this moment of clarity, Th\u00e4lmann continues to follow his political convictions and joins the workers at the Hamburg uprising in October 1923.",

The subsequent dictatorial regime with fascist features brought great violence and terror to the Chilean people. The accompanying neo-liberal economic system, which made the country one of the richest in the region, led to an ever-widening social gap in society, which in turn fell into a kind of passivity. In 2019, long after the dictator was voted out of office and the democratization that followed, a new social movement is shaking the prevailing order.

Apparently there is a real climate of fear in some film and theater productions. Some directors, but also well-known actors, apparently abuse their power and treat those around them on set or on stage with contempt or even abuse. Individual cases have been known for years, including under #metoo. But are they really isolated cases? Or can directors and actors allow themselves anything because the system allows it? In their three-year research, the documentary filmmakers spoke to more than 200 film and theater professionals about the problems in their industry. How much responsibility do the alleged perpetrators bear for abuse of power and how much responsibility does the financiers, production companies, broadcasters and also the audience bear?",

They seem to be in a somnambulistic state, either awake, asleep, existing, or not. In parallel with Turgenev's text, on counterpoint, the director unfolds his visual range, which enters into an obvious contradictory relationship with the words of the classic. The interaction of the characters on stage is absolutely independent of the author's remarks. Thus, Mirzoev visibly shades the intimate, to some extent Freudian motifs he saw in the play. However, Turgenev's text and Mirzoev's plastic searches turn \"Two Women\" into a curious stage experiment, rather unexpected for the aesthetics of Lenkom.",
