Prior to his breakthrough in 1972, he recorded a proto-metal record and a pop/rock album, eventually redefining glam rock with his ambiguously sexy Ziggy Stardust persona. Ziggy made Bowie an international star, yet he wasn't content with gleaming mere glitter rock. Each one of his phases in the '70s sparked a number of subgenres, including punk, new wave, goth rock, the new romantics, and electronica. Few rock heroes ever had such lasting impact. With just two days after his 69th birthday and the uncannily timed release of his most poignant album ‘Blackstar’, he left his fans with a parting gift that will solidify his already indelible mark in music history.","Documentary, Music"
